## Update preview of Data Toolkit and subsequent development plan

Hello anyone, this is Arcspark.

After putting our resources on the shelf in the unity asset store, we received some feedback,
some related to the functions of the [üóÉÔ∏è Data Toolkit](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/slug/224909), and most related to documentation.
After receiving these feedbacks, we immediately began to make adjustments. 
Now the [new document](https://github.com/Arcspak/Tutorials/blob/main/Data_Toolkit/Data_Toolkit_Quick_Tutorial.pdf) has been completed,
with more API descriptions and sample code, and covers all important functions as much as possible.
For some review reasons of Unity Asset Store, we cannot update the PDF document files in the published package in real time.
We therefore recommend that you check out our [online documentation page](https://github.com/Arcspak/Tutorials) for timely update.
